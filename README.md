ExceptionMonitor
================
A real-time exception monitor dashboard that can be integrated into any C# application.

The monitor itself is a simple information radiator written in ASP.NET MVC 4.

The package includes a proxy application using NServiceBus to listen for queued messages and make a SignalR connection 
to communicate with the dashboard.
